### Run locally

* Start a local webserver (e.g., Python's SimpleHTTPServer or MAMP) and open the project folder

### Develop

* Install npm package manager
* Open the project directory in the command line and run: `npm install`
* node_modules folder will be created automatically
* Run `gulp watch` in the command line to watch JavaScript or CSS changes. Gulp automatically compiles all files to *main.js* and *style.css*
in the */dist* folder.
* If you install new npm modules (e.g., external JS libraries) you have to update *gulpfile.js* and run `gulp`.
